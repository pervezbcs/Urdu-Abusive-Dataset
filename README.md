# Urdu-Abusive-Dataset
Urdu Language abusive text dataset
We collect 2,171 comments and designed a dataset of Urdu language from YouTube videos and designed a dataset. The dataset is manually annotated by three annotators who are the local speakers of the Urdu language. We provided them with a set of comments and a question “a comment is either abusive or not”.

Note: This dataset has not been published and is not permitted to any one to use for any purpose. It would be publically available for research purpose after it would be published in some jounal
